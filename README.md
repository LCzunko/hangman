## Why do you code?

I don't have much experience with coding. At my job as an accountant, I wrote some basic Excel VBA macros to automate reptetive tasks and make the workflow easier. This got me interested, and my knowledge grew somewhat but I was entirely self taught, relying on online resources.

I wanted to continue developing my skill, as I'd found coding interesting and useful. The company ran a basic javascript course which I signed up for. The course was limited in scope but quite engaging.

That experience solidified my desire to pursue coding seriously, and I started to look for an opportunity to properly learn the fundamentals and switch career tracks.
